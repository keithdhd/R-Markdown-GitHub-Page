## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This is a long link. Does it wrap? https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/b0135993-3d8a-4f3b-afcf-e01f4d52137c/resource/aee43295-2a13-48f6-bf05-92769ca7c6cf/download/ui_admissions_2023.csv/dataset/b0135993-3d8a-4f3b-afcf-e01f4d52137c/resource/aee43295-2a13-48f6-bf05-92769ca7c6cf/download/ui_admissions_2023.csv

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
